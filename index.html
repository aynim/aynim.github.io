 <body style="background-color:blue;"> 
  <h3> My names Ayni and welcome to my website! I was born in Columbus Ohio but raised in Seattle. I have 7 siblings and im the 2nd youngest. I was born on july 9th, my mom told me she was swimming when her water broke so im practically a fish. A couple things you should know about me are that i like to travel, most of my siblings live in new york so thats the place i visit the most. One really cool thing me and my sisters do are whenever we go on a trip we buy a record so we have a pretty large vinly collection. I love harry potter and cried wheni didnt recieve my hogwarts acceptance letter. Ive attended over 15 concerts... thats where most of my money goes. </h3>
